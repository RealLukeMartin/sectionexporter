 * Implements hook_menu().

 * Define menu items and page callbacks. This hook enables modules to register
 * paths in order to define how URL requests are handled. Paths may be registered
 * for URL handling only, or they can register a link to be placed in a menu
 * (usually the Navigation menu). A path and its associated information is
 * commonly called a "menu router item". This hook is rarely called (for example,
 * when modules are enabled), and its results are cached in the database.
 * hook_menu() implementations return an associative array whose keys define
 * paths and whose values are an.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of menu items. Each menu item has a key corresponding to the Drupal
 *   path being registered. The corresponding array value is an associative array
 *   that may contain the following key-value pairs: "title": Required. The
 *   untranslated title of the menu item. "title callback": Function to generate
 *   the title; defaults to t(). If you require only the raw string to be output,
 *   set this to FALSE. "title arguments": Arguments to send to t() or your
 *   custom callback, with path component substitution as described above.
